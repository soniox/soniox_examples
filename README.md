# Soniox examples

**Soniox examples** is a collection of ready-to-run code samples and demo apps for integrating the **Soniox Speech-to-Text (STT) API** into real products and applications.

This repository demonstrates how to:
- Transcribe or translate audio in real time
- Transcribe or translate recorded audio files asynchronously
- Use advanced context and configuration for higher transcription accuracy

The examples are designed to be practical, minimal, and easy to adapt to production use.
